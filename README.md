# Home sensor dashboard

A dashboard for home sensor data.  This is more of a playground for doing AWS
serverless development than a real useful project.

## Goals

This is intended as a sandbox/reference for building a site using AWS Lambdas,
API Gateway, and being able to test everything locally with localstack,
including the Terraform deployment.
