# Home sensor dashboard

A dashboard for home sensor data. This is more of a playground for doing AWS
serverless development than a real useful project.

All tools/dependencies are installed locally as much as possible. Check
[.envrc.example](./.envrc.example) for a sample of how to add the local tooling
to the local path for easier use.

## Goals

This is intended as a sandbox/reference for building a site using AWS Lambdas,
API Gateway, and being able to test everything locally with localstack,
including the Terraform deployment.
